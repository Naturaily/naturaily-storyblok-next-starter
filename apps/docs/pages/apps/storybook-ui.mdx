# Storybook UI

This application is a `Storybook`, a tool primarily used for developing UI components in isolation. It facilitates the creation and showcasing of various UI components by generating `stories` based on the [@natu/ui](/packages/ui) library. These stories serve as interactive documentation, allowing developers to visualize and interact with individual components independently of the larger application context. By leveraging Storybook along with the @natu/ui library, developers can efficiently iterate on and test UI components, ensuring consistency and quality across their projects. Storybook's ability to automatically generate stories from the `@natu/ui` library streamlines the development process, enabling developers to focus on building robust and visually appealing user interfaces.

## Available Scripts

Run storybook locally:

```bash copy
yarn storybook
```

Build storybook:

```bash copy
yarn storybook:build
```
