# Web

This application is the main application of the starter, which:

- is the web app created using imported packages of this starter,
- has a minimal amount of logic directly in it.

Ready app can be deployed, see [how to deploy apps on Vercel](/getting-started/deploy-on-vercel).

## Available scripts

Build ready-to-deploy, optimized production version of an app:

```bash copy
yarn build
```

Run app locally:

1. in **development mode**

```bash copy
yarn dev
```

2. in **production mode** (needs building an app first)

```bash copy
yarn start
```
