# Setup GH actions

We use GitHub Actions for code validation. If you want to use it, add an environmental variable to your repository.

```env copy
SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION="true"
```

It disables the validation of environments during GitHub Actions runtime.

You can edit the GitHub Action in this file:

```bash copy
.github/workflows/main.yml
```
