## ðŸ’» Custom ESlint configuration

[ESlint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) are tools that analyzes your code and helps you to keep it clean,
consistent, and error-free. This package is used as one source of truth for default ESlint configuration.

This package includes:

- ESlint configuration in `eslint-next.js` file,
- ordering imports schema in `order-imports.js` file.

It can be extended if needed for particular package or app purposes.
Extended config will inherit all the traits of this package's configuration (ex. rules, plugins, and language options)
and add or modify some of the options.

## ðŸ¤“ Usage

To use this package in other package or app you need to import it as dev dependency in its individual `package.json` file:

```json
"devDependencies": {
    "eslint-config-custom": "*",
}
```

Then include it in its individual `.eslintrc` file as the extended config:

```js
module.exports = {
  extends: ['eslint-config-custom/eslint-next.js'],
};
```

If you need to extend this ESlint configuration particularly for app or package, this is also the place to do so.
