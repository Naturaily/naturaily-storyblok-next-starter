## ðŸ’» Middlewares chaining

[Middlewares](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/middleware) are functions that
allow you to intersept the request and perform some action before sending the response to the user.
This package is chaining them one after another if using more of them.

It was described in details in the video below:

import Youtube from '../../components/youtube';

<Youtube id="fmFYH_Xu3d0" />

## ðŸ¤“ Usage

To use this package in the app import this package as a dependency in its individual `package.json` file:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@natu/middleware-chain": "*",
}
```

Then use it like in the example below:

```ts copy
import { middlewareChain } from '@natu/middleware-chain';
import { withStoryblokPreviewMiddleware } from '@natu/storyblok-preview';
import { withAuthMiddleware } from '@natu/auth';

const middlewares = [withStoryblokPreviewMiddleware, withAuthMiddleware];

export default middlewareChain(middlewares);
```
