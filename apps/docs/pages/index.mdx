# Introduction

**Welcome to the Naturaily Storyblok starter documentation!**

## What is our project?

We created this starter to accelerate our work by providing a ready-made set of tools, templates, and examples that facilitate the initiation of a project or task. With it, we can avoid the need for continuously recreating the same basic elements from scratch, saving time and effort. This starter serves as a solid foundation upon which we can quickly build our solution, focusing primarily on its development and customization to specific requirements, rather than wasting time on repeating the same initial steps.

## How to Use These Docs

On the left side of the screen, you'll find the docs navbar. The pages of the docs are organized sequentially, from basic to advanced, so you can follow them step-by-step when building your application. However, you can read them in any order or skip to the pages that apply to your use case.

On the right side of the screen, you'll see a table of contents that makes it easier to navigate between sections of a page. If you need to quickly find a page, you can use the search bar at the top, or the search shortcut (Ctrl+K or Cmd+K).

To get started, checkout the [Requirements](/getting-started/requirements) guide.
