# Naturaily's Jamstack starter

Welcome to the Naturaily Storyblok starter!

## What is our project?

It's a **ready-made set of tools, templates, and examples** that facilitate the initiation of a project or task.
With it, we can avoid the need for continuously recreating the same basic elements from scratch, saving time and effort.

Tech stack is based on:

- 🏎️ **Next.js** - fast and optimized React's framework
- 🌈 **Turborepo** - high-performance build system for JavaScript and TypeScript codebases
- 💅 **Tailwind CSS** - utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development

...including ready-to-use configurations:

- 📚 **Storyblok** - headless CMS to manage your content
- 📕 **Storybook** - for testing and showcasing components
- ✨ **ESlint** & **Prettier** - for clean, consistent, and error-free code
- 🚀 **GitHub Actions** for smooth workflows
- 💻 **T3 Env** - validation for type-safe environment variables
- 🧬 **Codegen** - for auto-generating code from your GraphQL schema
- 🔥 **Framer motion** - for powerful animations

...and much, much more.
